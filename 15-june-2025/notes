git init
git add .
git commit -m "change"
git push -u origin main / git push 
= to send changes to our remote repository

we are pushing to main 
==================================================

git status 
= file itself is not tracked


git add .
= add everything

git commit -m "new file added"

git push -u origin main

============================
Each and every commit has "id"

We can go to our previous commit as well

We can also upload files via "UI" or create itself
e.g. b.txt
= commit itself

In our remote repository we have 3 files
file1
file2
file3

Local:
file1
file2
= i don't have file3

= git will throw error [number of files are inconsitency/not matching]
= multiple people working on same github

git pull
= it will check from the remote repository vs current repository/local files are updated or not
= bring changes from remote repository to local repository
= we can see the file in local system
